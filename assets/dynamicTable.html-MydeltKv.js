Querying dynamic tables yields a Continuous Query. A continuous query <strong>never terminates</strong> and <strong>produces dynamic results</strong> - another dynamic table.

In contrast to a batch query, a continuous query <strong>never terminates</strong> and <strong>updates its result table according to its input tables’ updates</strong>.</p><h3 id="groupby" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#groupby" aria-hidden="true">#</a> groupby</h3><p>The following figure shows how the query is evaluated over time as the clicks table is updated with additional rows. <img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"> When the query starts, the <code>clicks</code> table (left-hand side) is empty. The query computes the result table when the first row is <code>inserted</code>. After the first row <code>[Mary, ./home]</code> arrives, the result table (right-hand side, top) consists of a single row <code>[Mary, 1]</code>. When the second row <code>[Bob, ./cart]</code> is <code>inserted</code> into the clicks table, the query updates the result table and inserts a new row <code>[Bob, 1]</code>. The third row, <code>[Mary, ./prod?id=1]</code> yields an <code>update</code> of an already computed result row such that <code>[Mary, 1]</code> is updated to <code>[Mary, 2]</code>.</p><h3 id="window" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#window" aria-hidden="true">#</a> window</h3><p>The second query is similar to the first one but groups the <code>clicks</code> table in addition to the user attribute also on an <code>hourly tumbling window</code> before it counts the number of URLs. <img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"> The query <strong>continuously computes results every hour</strong> and updates the result table. The clicks table contains four rows with timestamps (cTime) between 12:00:00 and 12:59:59.The query computes two results rows from this input (one for each user) and <code>appends</code> them to the result table. For the next window between 13:00:00 and 13:59:59, the clicks table contains three rows, which results in another two rows being <code>appended</code> to the result table. The result table is updated as more rows are <code>appended</code> to clicks over time.</p><h3 id="update-and-append-queries" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#update-and-append-queries" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Update and Append Queries</h3><p>The first query updates previously emitted results, i.e., the changelog stream that defines the result table contains <code>INSERT</code> and <code>UPDATE</code> changes. The second query only appends to the result table, i.e., the result table’s changelog stream only consists of <code>INSERT</code> changes.</p><h3 id="query-restrictions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#query-restrictions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Query Restrictions</h3><p>Some queries are too expensive to compute, either due to the size of state they need to maintain or because computing updates is too expensive.</p><ul><li><p><strong>State Size</strong>: Continuous queries are evaluated on unbounded streams and are often supposed to run for weeks or months. Hence, the total amount of data that a continuous query processes can be very large.</p></li><li><p><strong>Computing Updates</strong>: Some queries require to recompute and update a large fraction of the emitted result rows even if only a single input record is added or updated. An example is the query that computes a RANK for each user based on the time of the last click.</p></li></ul><h2 id="table-to-stream-conversion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#table-to-stream-conversion" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Table to Stream Conversion</h2><p>A dynamic table can be continuously modified by <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, and <code>DELETE</code> changes just like a regular database table.When converting a dynamic table into a stream or writing it to an external system, these changes need to be encoded. Flink’s Table API and SQL support three ways to encode the changes of a dynamic table:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Append-only stream</strong>: A dynamic table that is only modified by INSERT changes can be converted into a stream by emitting the inserted rows.</p></li><li><p><strong>Retract stream</strong>: A retract stream is a stream with two types of messages, <code>add messages</code> and <code>retract messages</code>.A dynamic table is converted into a retract stream by encoding an <code>INSERT</code> change as <code>add message</code>, a <code>DELETE</code> change as a <code>retract message</code>, and an <code>UPDATE</code> change as a <code>retract message for the updated (previous) row</code>, and an additional message for the updating (new) row. <img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></li><li><p><strong>Upsert stream</strong>: An upsert stream is a stream with two types of messages, <code>upsert messages</code> and <code>delete messages</code>. A dynamic table that is converted into an upsert stream requires a (possibly composite) <strong>unique key</strong>. A dynamic table with a unique key is transformed into a stream by encoding <code>INSERT</code> and <code>UPDATE</code> changes as <code>upsert messages</code> and <code>DELETE</code> changes as <code>delete messages</code>. <strong>The stream consuming operator needs to be aware of the unique key attribute to apply messages correctly</strong>. The main difference to a retract stream is that UPDATE changes are encoded with a single message and hence more efficient.</p></li></ul><p>refs: https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/dev/table/concepts/dynamic_tables/</p>',21),u=[l];function h(m,p){return t(),a("div",null,u)}const b=e(c,[["render",h],["__file","dynamicTable.html.vue"]]);export{b as default};
