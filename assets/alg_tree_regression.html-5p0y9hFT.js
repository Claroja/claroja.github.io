Let&#39;s focus on the two observations with the smallest <code>Dosages</code>. Their average <code>Dosage</code> is 3 and that corresponds to this dotted <code>red line</code>.Now we can build very simple tree that splits the observations into two groups based whether or not <code>Dosage &lt; 3</code>. The point on the far left is the only one with <code>Dosage &lt; 3</code> and the average <code>Drug Effectiveness</code> for that one point is 0. So we put 0 in the leaf on the left side, for when <code>Dosage &lt; 3</code>. All of the other points have <code>Dosage &gt;=3</code> and the average <code>Drug Effectiveness</code> for all of the points with <code>Dosage &gt;=3</code> is 38.8(the green line). So we put 38.8 in the leaf on the right side, for when the <code>Dosage &gt;= 3</code>.</p><figure><img src="'+p+'" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The values in each leaf are the predictions that this simple tree will make for <code>Drug Effectiveness</code>. For example, this point, on the far left, has <code>Dosage &lt; 3</code> and the tree predicts that the <code>Drug Effectiveness</code> will be 0.It&#39;s pretty good. <img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>In contrast, for this point, which has <code>Dosage &gt; 3</code>, the tree predicts that the <code>Drug Effectiveness</code> will be 38.8 ant that prediction is not very good, since the observed <code>Drug Effectiveness</code> is 100%. <img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"> NOTE: We can visualize how bad the prediction is by drawing a dotted line between observed and predicted values. In other words, this dotted line is a residual. For each point in the data, we can draw its residual, the difference between the observed and predicted values and we can use the residuals to quantify the quality of these predictions. <img src="'+f+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>NOTE: We can plot the sum of squared residuals on this graph. The y-axis corresponds to the sum of squared residuals and the x-axis corresponds to Dosage thresholds.

In summary, we split the data into two groups by finding the threshold that gave us the smallest sum of squared residuals. <img src="'+_+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>As the same process, we can divide the observations with <code>Dosage &lt; 14.5</code> into 3 separate groups. Two of these leaves only contain one observation each and can not be split into smaller groups.In contrast, <code>Average = 0</code> leaf contains 4 observations. That said, those 4 observations all have the same <code>Drug Effectiveness</code>, so we don&#39;t need to split them into smaller groups. So we are done splitting the observations with <code>Dosage &lt; 14.5</code> into smaller groups. <img src="'+b+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>When a model fits the training set perfectly, it probably means it is overfit and will not perform well with new data. In machine learning lingo, the model has no bias, but potentially large variance.Is there a way to prevent our tree from overfitting the training data? The simplest is to only split observations when there are more than some minimum number. Set the minimum to 7. In other words, since there are only 6 observations with <code>Dosage &lt; 14.5</code>, we will not split the observations in this node and the output will be the average <code>Drug Effectiveness</code> for the 6 observations with <code>Dosage &lt; 14.5</code>, 4.2%. <img src="'+y+'" alt="" loading="lazy"> Since we have more than 7 observations on the right side(with <code>Dosage &gt;=14.5</code>), we can split them into two groups and more... <img src="'+D+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>for more than one predictor, the process is same as classification tree. <img src="'+x+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>refs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9c66TUylZ4</p>',10),I=[T,E,k];function N(q,M){return o(),n("div",null,I)}const W=a(z,[["render",N],["__file","alg_tree_regression.html.vue"]]);export{W as default};
